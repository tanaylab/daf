DAF 0.1.0-dev.1 - Data in Axes in Files
=======================================

    :alt: Documentation Status

The daf package provides a uniform generic interface for accessing 1D and 2D data arranged along some set of axes. This
is a much-needed generalization of the `annotated data <https://pypi.org/project/anndata>`_ functionality. The key
features are:

* Support both in-memory and persistent (file based) data storage.

* Allows storing the data in a collection of simple memory-mapped files, as well as in arbitrary complex formats using
  format adapters (in particular, allow using daf to access ``AnnData``, e.g. to access ``h5ad`` files).

* The data model is based on (1) some axes, (2) 1-D vectors of data indexed by a single axis, (3) 2-D matrices indexed
  by a pair of axis, and (4) 0-D data (arbitrary blobs).

* There is explicit control over matrix layout (row or column major), and support for both dense and sparse matrices,
  both of which are crucial for performance.

* Allows accessing the data as either plain numpy arrays, scipy csr/csc sparse matrices, or as pandas series/frames.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

    import daf
    import numpy as np
    import scipy.sparse as sp

    # Open an existing DAF storage
    data = daf.open("daf.yaml")

    # Access an arbitrary blob.
    name = daf.get_datum("name")

    # Get a numpy 1D vector by axis and name.
    metacell_types = data.get_vector("metacell:type")

    # Get a Pandas series by axis and name.
    type_colors = data.get_series("type:color")

    # Combine these to get a Pandas series of the color of each metacell.
    metacell_colors = type_colors[metacell_types]

    # Get a 2D matrix by two axes and a name.
    umis_matrix = data.get_matrix("cell,gene:UMIs", layout="row_major")

    if isinstance(umis_matrix, np.ndarray):
        # Umis matrix is dense
        ...
    else:
        assert isinstance(umis_matrix, sp.csr_matrix)
        # Umis matrix is sparse
        ...

    # Get a Pandas data frame by two axes and a name.
    type_marker_genes = data.get_frame("gene,type:marker", layout="column_major")

    # Access the mask of marker genes for a specific type.
    type_marker_genes["T"]

    # Get a Pandas data frame containing multiple named vectors (columns) of the same axis (always column-major).
    genes_masks = data.get_table("gene", ["forbidden", "significant"])

    # Access the mask of significant genes.
    genes_masks["significant"]

See the `documentation <https://daf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_ for the full API details.

Installation
------------

In short: ``pip install daf``. Note that ``metacells`` requires many "heavy" dependencies, most notably ``numpy``,
``pandas``, ``scipy``, ``scanpy``, which ``pip`` should automatically install for you. If you are running inside a
``conda`` environment, you might prefer to use it to first install these dependencies, instead of having ``pip`` install
them from ``PyPI``.
